/// This function is called by token contracts. It delegates to deposit or repay
/// logic based on the payload.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - The contract environment
/// * `token_asset` - The address of the token contract (should be the caller)
/// * `from` - The address that sent the tokens
/// * `amount` - The amount of tokens sent
/// * `payload` - A vector containing custom data (expected: [Symbol])
