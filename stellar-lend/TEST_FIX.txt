INTEGRATION TEST FIX - ALL TESTS PASSING ✅
================================================================================

ISSUE FIXED:
------------
Test: test_error_handling_and_retries
File: client/tests/integration_tests.rs (line 320-349)

Error:
thread 'test_error_handling_and_retries' panicked
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: MaxRetriesExceeded(1)

Root Cause:
- Test configured max_retries = 1 (allows 1 retry = 2 total attempts)
- Test mocked 2 failures before success (requires 3 total attempts)
- After 2 attempts, client gave up with MaxRetriesExceeded error

Fix Applied:
- Changed mock to fail only 1 time (up_to_n_times(1) instead of 2)
- Now: 1st attempt fails → retry → 2nd attempt succeeds ✓
- Matches the max_retries = 1 configuration

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
